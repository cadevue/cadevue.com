# Description
Two astronauts stranded in space inside the asteroid belt, facing their final fate. Between hope and despair, they perform their one last dance together, a dance of life and death.

This game was made for Solo Dev Game Jam #4 with the theme **'Two Button Controls'**.

# Credits
This is part of Solo Dev Game Jam #4, so I did everything by myself! 

I did use some assets from the internet, which are listed below.

- Space Ambience from Freesound.org
- Stone Hit from Freesound.org

For the tools, I used Unity as the game engine, Aseprite for the pixel art, and Audacity for audio editing.
