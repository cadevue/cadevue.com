This program is a simple simulation of the Raft Consensus Protocol. The program is implemented in golang.

# How to Run üöÄ
## Running the Server üñ•Ô∏è
- As first node (automatically become leader)
    ```bash
    go run server/server.go <ip server> <port server>
    ```
- As follower node

    ```bash 
    go run server/server.go <ip server> <port server> <ip leader server> <port leader server>
    ```

## Running the Client üë®üèª‚Äçüíº
### Method 1: Web Interface üß©
```bash 
go run web-client/web_client.go <ip server> <port server>
```

### Method 2: The Terminal </>
```bash
go run client/client.go <ip server> <port server>
```

> Notes: Make sure the leader server address is an active leader node, if not the terminal will prompt the correct leader address

# Available Command
1. &nbsp;**Ping** <br>
Checking the server connection. <br>

    ```bash
    ping
    ```
    The server will response with:

    ```bash

    ```

<br>

2. &nbsp;**Get** <br>

    ```
    The server will response with:
    ```bash
    OK
    ```
    <br>If the key doesn't exist, new pair will be created. This command only available for leader node, if not it will return error message and a correct leader address. This command will be logged.

<br>

4. &nbsp;**Strln** <br>
Get the length of a value with a key.

    ```bash
    strln <key>
    ```
    The server will response with:
    ```bash
    <value length>
    ```
    <br>If the key doesn't exist, it will return -1.

<br>

5. &nbsp;**Del** <br>
Delete value for specific key.

    ```bash
    del <key>
    ```
    The server will response with:
    ```bash
    <deleted value>
    ```
    <br>If the key doesn't exist, it will return empty string. This command only available for leader node, if not it will return error message and a correct leader address. This command will be logged.

<br>

6. &nbsp;**Append** <br>
Append value for specific key.

    ```bash
    append <key> <value>
    ```
    The server will response with:
    ```bash
    OK
    ```
    <br>If the key doesn't exist, new pair will be created. This command only available for leader node, if not it will return error message and a correct leader address. This command will be logged.

<br>

7. &nbsp;**Switch** <br>
Switch server port.

    ```bash
    switch <ip server> <port server>
    ```
    The server will response with:

    ```
