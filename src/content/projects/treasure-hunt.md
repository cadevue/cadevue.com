<!-- # About This Project 
This project is made as part of my Computer Science Study at Bandung Institute of Technology. The specific course related to this project is IF2211 Algorithm Strategy. It focus specifically on the two searching algorithm: BFS and DFS.

This project is redone on February 20205. The original project can be found in this repository, which was implemented in C#: <br>

# Project Description 
A web application that solve the treasure hunt problem using Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. The application visualize how a ship traverse the ocean (grid-based) map to find the treasure using the two algorithms.

The technologies used for the application are:
- **React** as the frontend framework
- **Typescript** as the language
- **Vite** for the frontend bundler
- **TailwindCSS** for the styling
- **Vercel** for the deployment
