# Description
Todongta Saga is a game inspired by the rich traditions of Batak culture. It revolves around Dalihan Na Tolu, a fundamental philosophy that shapes Batak society and social interactions. This concept is based on three key roles that create a balanced community:
1. Somba Marhulahula – Showing deep respect toward the family of one's wife or mother.
2. Elek Marboru – Providing care and support to daughters and those who receive them in marriage.
3. Manat Mardongan Tubu – Maintaining harmony and caution in relationships with those of the same clan.
