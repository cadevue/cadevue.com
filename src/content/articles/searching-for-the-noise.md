Life has never feel too tough for me, not to say it in an arrogant manner. Of course, there were little bumps along the way, but never ones that makes me really stumble. I've been getting everything I want, went to the school I wish for and graduated with good grade. None of which I took for granted, I'm so grateful that I've been raised greatly by my parents and have lived in a privileged environment.

It has been a great life in the frame of social expectations. A life that our education system decribes as success. But now, at the moment where it actually matters, I'm lost — or at least it feels like it.

<i>Was it a gift? or a curse?</i>

It can sound very ungrateful how I say it, but really though. I've come to realization that my life has not been very interesting. I've never had a relationship, never went to a party, never had a fun trip I could tell about. All of my life has just been me staying in comfort. And now, I'm 22 with little to no story to share.

And what's on the end of the rail?

<i>Silence. Boredom. Loneliness.</i>

<!-- Now i feel so left behind. In the sea of people who keep walking forward. Yet, I'm still hesitant about my next step. Staying in this job that I love the most -->

<!-- Then the next stage is clear. Get philosophical, starting from the question of "What our life means?". Because in the end, we're all the same, just a soul who happens to live in this world. -->
<!-- Of course we can answer this with  -->
<!-- I am just an . -->
<!-- Also, one realization comes to mind. The past never really matters. Only the present is -->
<!-- So, I have to start embracing the noise from now on. -->

<!-- Now, I want to be grateful for a while, since up to this point, I've just been whining.  -->
<!-- I'm grateful that I can think of this. I think it's the biggest capital you can get to live a sat -->
<!---->
<!-- I would say it's a privilege that I'm in this situation, cause that means i have more freedom to choose what I want in life. It's a privilege to be a consumer. -->
<!-- The position that I'm in  -->

<!-- So here it is, I'm ready for the noise! starting by writing. Expose myself to the world, let the music flows in. -->
<!---->
<!-- What's a mind full , if it only screams to the void? It's only a rail construction that's never finished. -->
<!-- Writing this also doesn't feel easy. I feel so exposed, thinking about how you will perceive me after reading this. But that's the risk I'm willing to take. So here it is, the start of my journey to find my noise.  -->
<!-- So here I am. Writing this article in a cafe I've visited probably hundreds of times already -->

<!-- Maybe some of you  -->
