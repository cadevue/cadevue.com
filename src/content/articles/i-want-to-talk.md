After some times working on the website, I discover more about myself, my passion in programming, and my obsession with life that I rarely talk about. I'm 21, . And I really, really want to talk and discuss about these things. I want to have nerd discussions. I want to have deep conversations. I'd love to be vulnerable and be real.

And the fact that you read this article up to this point shows, that you actually care to some extent. And I just want you to know that I really appreciate that. Even if no one's reading my articles, I would still be happy that I write these. Let this website be the graveyard of my thoughts and feelings.

So with all that, I want to talk. I want this website to be a safe space for me, where I can share about my interests, opinion, and feelings.
