dear friend,<br>
how excited we were upon the clouds <br>
said we'd jet through them and build a castle<br>
not today, but it's okay <br>
as long as we're sustainable<br>

dear friend,<br>
do you remember about the stars<br>
said we'd gleam so bright and steal their shine<br>
maybe tomorrow, but it's okay<br>
as long as we're sustainable<br>

dear friend,<br>
we mused about crossing the ocean<br>
said we'd conquer the tides and catch every fish<br>
not easy, but it's okay<br>
as long as we're sustainable<br>

dear love,<br>
this morning I saw clouds crumble in raging gray<br>
the stars' shine couldn't reach my lingering fog<br>
the dark ocean climbed and swallowed my face<br>

i took a ~wrong~ different path<br>
what a waste<br>
i'm no longer sustainable
