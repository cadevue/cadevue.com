## What is CS-202 ‚ùì
CS-202 is an open challenge for computer science students or hobbyist developer who wants to learn/improve their software engineering skills and deepen the knowledge in computer science fundamentals.

This is taken from

This is pure just a challenge. There will be no prize, certificate, or anything like that. The only thing you will get is the satisfaction of completing the challenge, and I'm sure if you done all of the projects, you will have a very good portfolio that you can show!

## Goals üéØ
The goals of CS-202 is mainly two things:
1. Refining the portfolio with wide range of projects.
2. Enhancing the understanding of the CS fundamentals.

This is a very flexible list! I can and probably will add or remove subjects as I see fit. What I can see is this list will be extended as I go through the challenge and become part of my life-long learning journey.
